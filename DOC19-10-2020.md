# SRS-simulation
Contains all functions and files related to the "Stimulated Raman scattering simulation for imaging optimization" paper. The optimization simulation and imaging simulation.  
Uploaded: 
1. Optimal settings: OptimalSettingsInterface.mlapp, SystematicSettings.m, LIAOptimalSettings.m. LIAoptimalSettings.m is a function in SystematicSettings.m, which is the source code for the OptimalSettingsInterface.mlapp app. This app is actually a GUI to run the simulation. More details are in README Optimal Settings.txt
2. Imaging simulation: SimulationLIA.m is the source code for the ImagingSimulationInterface.mlapp app (GUI). Double Stokes modulation schematic.PNG, Pump and Stokes modulation schematic.PNG, Stokes modulation schematic.PNG should be in the same folder as the app. More details are in the README Imaging Simulation.txt
The apps and .m files are matlab codes.
